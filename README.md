Upload-Manager
==============

Upload Management using Flow php server and AngularJS. Its built as a package for Laravel 4.2.x. The main aspect of this package is its used to upload big-sized media files (in my case mp3 files) to the server even though there is a 2MB max limit (i.e. on shared hostings). This feature has been achieved by ng-flow-php server chunk file uploads. And its interface is in AngularJS.  Its still in its development stage.
